[Instagram Bot](#Instagram-Bot-Quick-Start)

## ðŸ¤– Instagram Bot Quick Start ðŸ¤–

Edit `engage.py` and add you ***Username***, ***Password***, and ***hashtags*** you want to use.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you're on a **Mac**, you can run

```
chmod +x mac_run.command

&&

./mac_run.command
```

If you're on **Windows**, you can run:

```
python3 engage.py
```

## Troubleshooting

The most common issues are not being able to log in and photo URLs not loading.

If you're getting the ***`Please wait a few minutes before you try again`*** error, Instagram thinks you're being sus. Wait an hour before running the bot.

If the photo URLs from the hashtags are not loading, try to increase the sleep time in the `like_photo()` function. Check the developer console; if you're getting a 429 error, then Instagram thinks you're being sus again. Wait an hour before running the bot.
